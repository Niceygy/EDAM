    <p>EDAM takes the current steam players and uploaders to EDDN & shows you the data.</p>

    <h3>Note on EDDN numbers</h3>
    <p>Becuase of the privacy focused nature of the EDDN, it is rather hard to get accurate numbers on how many people are using it and how active they are.</p>
    <p>For this app, I have made a best guess based on how many FSDJump and Docked messages I recive per minute</p>
    <p>(this is becuase neither of these can be spammed that often, and give a good rough estimate as to how much the player is moving)</p>
    <p>If you have a better idea, <a href="https://go.niceygy.net/mailme">email me!</a></p>
